# Movies-Web-Page
This is a web page that I programmed which uses SpringBoot as its backend, AngularJs as its frontend, and MySQL as its database. The web page provides all sorts of functionalities such as:
login/signup users, fetch and sort movies, fetch and sort actors of a movie, provide information of each movie, purchase movies, employee web page panel, and complex movie search 
options.
